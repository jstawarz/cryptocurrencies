# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview of Project

In this project, we are working with Martha at Accountability Accounting. Accountability Accounting is looking to offer a cryptocurrency investment
portfolio for its customers. Our task will be to generate a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the market and how they could be grouped
in order to create a classification system for this new investment. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project will be to help Martha create a report on cryptocurrencies to present to the board of Accountability Accounting. 
Together,we will clean the data, utilize unsupervised machine learning to group the cryptocurrencies, and lastly create visualizations to 
demonstrate the findings.
